# FlatPanelAmplifier
This is the schematic for a custom guitar amplifier circuit with tone and volume controls. The crossover was designed based on the response of the flat panel. Included is the poster used for presentation at senior design day at the University of Rochester.

Download the .asc file and run it in LTSpice. You should see the crossover at around 510 Hz.
